    <h1>STUDENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM</h1>
    <div class="top">
        <h2>What does student management system mean?</h2>
        <p>A Student Management System is also known as a Student Information System (SIS). These systems work to
            coordinate scheduling and communications between faculty regarding students. This system exists to simplify
            information tracking for both parents and administrative staff.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="top">
        <h2>What is the purpose of a student information system?</h2>
        <p>A student information system (SIS), student management system, school administration software or student
            administration system is a management information system for education sector establishments used to manage
            student data. It integrates students, parents, teachers and the administration. Student information systems
            provide capabilities for registering students in courses; documenting grading, transcripts of academic
            achievement and co-curricular activities, and the results of student assessment scores; forming student
            schedules; tracking student attendance; generating reports and managing other student-related data needs in
            an educational institution.

            Information security is a concern, as universities house an array of sensitive personal information, making
            them potentially attractive targets for security breaches, such as those experienced by retail corporations
            or healthcare providers]</p>
    </div>
    <div class="top">
        <h2>
            Why is student management system important?
            </h2>
        <p>The main objective for any school is the dissemination of information in an environment that encourages
            accountability, relevance and retention of the information gathered. Such are the main significances of a
            school administrator, who, as a student manager, is charged with allowing this opportunity and environment
            to occur on behalf of the students.

            The education system has constantly been evolving, hence to keep up with new channels of education we need
            to evolve our system to store information by automating the traditional ways and bringing more structure to
            the curriculum because today the world is on the verge of continuous evolution and so are we. The education
            systems all over the world are getting better along with getting complex. These systems are growing in size
            as well as scope, therefore it needs to be defined management for smooth functioning to keep up with new
            modes of information and new channels of education.</p>
        <h3>Along with this, the 5 reasons why should a student management system be prioritized in today’s time are
            listed below</h3>
        
            <h4>1. Highly improvised outputs:</h4>

        <p>
        The ultimate aim of any school is towards generating the best outputs from the students. In fact, the
            students on their end develop a sense of learning and exploring through these student management systems.
            Not just this but the students themselves are now much more devoted and interested along with their
            academics linings using a school/student management system.</p>

        <h4> 2. Anytime and anywhere access:</h4>

        <p>
        These automated systems give us all time universal access to the portals and therefore it is very beneficial
            for students and their studies. It is beneficial not only for the students but also for parents and teachers
            to keep strong control over the system.</p>

        <h4> 3. Streamlines the whole process:</h4>

        <p>
        Day to day processes with these systems can be managed in a much efficient way. These systems give a unified
            view that helps the user to perform activities. It also helps remind which activities an individual needs to
            perform and which of them are already done.</p>

        <h4> 4. Reviewing students’performance:</h4>

        <p> It's quite easy to review the performances of students with the help of automated reports and analytics.
            These systems help students keep a record of their own performance but also work on the areas or subjects
            they are weak at.</p>

        <h4>5. Better Communication:</h4>

            <p>It is on platforms such as these that the students can ask as many questions as they want to and clear all
            the doubts that they have. Quite often these systems have alumni tabs as well, where the students can stay
            in touch with their seniors who have left the school and get valuable help from them in educational matters.
            These people have already been there and done that, and as such their experience–both of the school as
            well as of the world outside–can prove to be of major help for these students.</p>
